Q. Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.


Ans : 

Data Types: 

    --> It is used to define what kind of data is used in the variable.

(i) Primitive: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, null, Symbol, bigInt.

    --> Primitive data types are immutable.
    --> It can have only single value.

-- Primitive Data Type Examples --

1.Number
Integers,float,decimal,exponential etc
Ex: 
let z = 2; 
Ex:
console.log(z);

2.String
Sequence of characters stored within double quotes/single quotes, backticks
Ex: 
var userName="Akshay”;
console.log(userName);

3.boolean
True/false
Ex: 
let y = true;
console.log(y);

4.undefined
Variable is defined but not initialised.
Ex: 
let a;
console.log(a);

5.null
Null is the absence of object or empty space
Ex:
let b = null;
console.log(b);


(ii) Non Primitive: class, objects, functions, Array, sets, map.

    --> Non primitive data types are mutable.
    --> It have multiple values.

-- Non-Primitive Data Type Examples --

1. Class:
A blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods.

2.Object:
A collection of key-value pairs.
Ex:
let name = {
  name: "Akshay",
  age: 20
};

3.Functions
A reusable block of code that can be executed when called.
Ex:
function greet(name) {
  return `Hi, ${name}!`;
}

4. Arrays
An ordered list of elements (can be of different types).
Ex:
let cars = ["Mercedes Benz", "Ferari", "Audi"];
